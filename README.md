# Computer Graphics Projects (C++ & OpenGL)

This repository contains 2D and 3D interactive graphics projects developed using C++ and OpenGL as part of my Computer Graphics course. These projects demonstrate basic rendering, object control, and camera manipulation using Visual Studio on Windows.

## 🚏 1. 2D City Scene Animation

A simple 2D city environment that includes:
- A ship moving across the sea
- A bus on the road
- An airplane flying in the sky

All objects are interactively controlled using keyboard and mouse (callback functions).

### 👨‍💻 Tools:
- C++
- OpenGL
- GLUT
- Visual Studio

## 🌍 2. 3D Desk & Rotating Globe

A 3D visual scene that contains:
- A desk (table)
- A 3D globe that can be rotated
- Camera control for viewing the scene from different angles (top, bottom, side)

### 👨‍💻 Tools:
- C++
- OpenGL
- GLUT
- Visual Studio
